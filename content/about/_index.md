Hello! I'm Andy, an aspiring data scientist with a deep passion for transforming data into actionable insights and building technology products. Currently, I am honing my skills as a Senior Data Analyst, where I leverage my expertise in SQL, Python, and Power BI to drive data-driven decision-making and optimize business processes.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have extensive experience in strategic planning, operations, and policy development through the appointments I held in my first career role. Beyond my professional achievements, I am committed to continuous learning and growth. I actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge in artificial intelligence, web development, cloud computing, and project management. My recent endeavors include fine-tuning large language models and exploring the fascinating world of machine learning.

As I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of data science, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to the field by staying at the forefront of technological advancements and applying them to real-world challenges. Whether itâ€™s automating processes to improve efficiency or developing models that provide deeper insights, I am driven by the impact that well-crafted data solutions can have on businesses and society.
